	"Mansion_heist_briefing" : "Sir Elmsworth's mansion is expensive.  Think top 10% of richest families expensive.  Over the years, he's collected a valuable assortment of artifacts and treasures, some he acquired himself as an archeological assistant, and some he got straight from his own pocket. Worst part, though, is that he keeps them all in his mansion... as eye candy.  One might say that they'd be better served fenced on the black market.\n\nUnfortunately, also over the years, Elmsworth sense of paranoia has... ah... strengthened.  He has insomnia, and paces around his place at night, making sure all of his valuables are still safe.  As a result, before we can even think about snagging anything of his, we'll have to prepare some fakes and swap out anything we take with our own versions.  He won't know until days later!",
