	"safehouse_meth_briefing_narrative" : "Hey guys, its Bain. Y'all Remember our old safehouse? The one we bailed on to get an upgrade? Well, seems some ruskis have turned it into a meth factory and coke storage center, as a big part of their narco trade in the DC area.\nOur plan is to go in loud, and cook as much meth as possible, and take as many assets from the vault as we can. They are bound to have some products locked away.\n\nWe are using an airborne asset for extracting coke and meth, but not for extracting you. The van is your way out.\n\nOur rookie pilot cannot communicate because he needs to focus on flying. You will need to check for him every so often. He will fly in at a regular schedule and will be in the area for aproximately two minutes each flyby. You have 30 minutes to get everything done, but you can leave only after grabbing all contents of the vault.\n\nBy the way, police are swarming the place, due to a tip off by a snitch, so being quiet is not an option."
