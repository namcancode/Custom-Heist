	"vo_day1_john_briefing2" : "Take possession of every valuable in the house. I heard there may be a vault somewhere inside. Should be worth investigating.",
	"vo_day1_john_briefing3" : "Snatch up every piece of jewelry you see. If you see a vault, make sure to raid that as well. Greater protection means greater profit.",
	"vo_day1_john_enoughloot1" : "You have what I require. Take more, should you find it prudent, or make your escape.",
	"vo_day1_john_esdamp1" : "The ESDAMP could easily fry the circuitry and make this problem moot.",
	"vo_day1_john_esdamp2" : "Good thing you brought the ESDAMP. It should make short work of this problem.",
	"vo_day1_john_esdamp3" : "The power boost of the ESDAMP should greatly simplify this conundrum.",
	"vo_day1_john_findcomputer1" : "Well, this is rather inconvenient. The vault is locked. The central computer system is what you're looking for.",
	"vo_day1_john_findcomputer2" : "Successfully hacking the computer system should open the vault.",
	"vo_day1_john_findcomputer3" : "Hack into the system to open that vault and take the riches inside.",
	"vo_day1_john_findcomputer4" : "The system is complex, but I'm positive a group of your caliber can hack into it.",
	"vo_day1_john_findkeycards" : "Keycards. Well, this is rather unfortunate. There should be a few of them scattered throughout the house.",
	"vo_day1_john_findphone1" : "Hmm...There are a few potential locations for that phone.",
	"vo_day1_john_findphone2" : "The phone you need could be in a few different places around the house.",
	"vo_day1_john_flashdrive1" : "Excellent, that's the flash drive we seek. Return to the laptop.",
	"vo_day1_john_flashdrive2" : "A flashdrive? This may prove useful.",
	"vo_day1_john_grabitall1" : "Jackpot. Take it all!",
	"vo_day1_john_grabitall2" : "Excellent. Don't be shy. Rob the vault with reckless abandon!",
	"vo_day1_john_grabitall3" : "Success. Now would be a good time to let greed get the better of you.",
	"vo_day1_john_greatfind1" : "Ah, what a gem! This is the kind of treasure I was anticipating.",
	"vo_day1_john_greatfind2" : "This is the precious, meticulously crafted treasure I was hoping for.",
	"vo_day1_john_greatfind3" : "This is exactly what my collection needed. Absolutely stunning.",
	"vo_day1_john_greatfind4" : "I wasn't expecting nearly this much treasure.",
	"vo_day1_john_greatfind5" : "Oh my...I had no idea this much jewelry was on the premises.",
	"vo_day1_john_greatfind6" : "All this jewelry...grab everything you can get your carefully gloved hands on.",
	"vo_day1_john_greatfind7" : "This will make a fine addition to my collection.",
	"vo_day1_john_hackfinished1" : "Excellent! The vault is now open, ready to be plundered.",
	"vo_day1_john_hackfinished2" : "Hack successful. Go see what lies within the vault.",
	"vo_day1_john_hackfinished3" : "A computer system is no match for the Payday Gang. Perfect. Let's see what treasure awaits us inside.",
	"vo_day1_john_holdit1" : "Wait! Don't step inside yet.",
	"vo_day1_john_holdit2" : "Just a moment!",
	"vo_day1_john_holdit3" : "Don't grab the jewelry yet.",
	"vo_day1_john_holdit4" : "Gentlemen, restrain yourselves for a moment.",
	"vo_day1_john_keycardasset" : "Keycards? Looks like you made an excellent choice in bringing these.",
	"vo_day1_john_keycode" : "A keypad? You gentlemen should have the code for that. Enter it.",
	"vo_day1_john_locationsmarked" : "I've marked their locations for you. Sally forth!",
	"vo_day1_john_minbags3" : "Three bags is the minimum.",
	"vo_day1_john_minbags4" : "I need at least four bags of valuables.",
	"vo_day1_john_minbags6" : "I'm sure you can handle at least six bags of jewelry.",
	"vo_day1_john_minbags7" : "Seven bags. And more, if you can manage.",
	"vo_day1_john_minbags8" : "I require at least eight bags, although I'll certainly take more.",
	"vo_day1_john_minbags10" : "Ten bags should suffice, but should it be feasible, grab everything you can.",
	"vo_day1_john_nextkeycard" : "Insert the second keycard. I can barely contain my excitement!",
	"vo_day1_john_notenough1" : "Even with the vault, we don't have quite enough treasure yet. Keep searching.",
	"vo_day1_john_patchedin1" : "Gentlemen, can you hear me?",
	"vo_day1_john_patchedin2" : "Have I been patched in? Ah, excellent.",
	"vo_day1_john_patchedin3" : "Hello? Good, good, communication is working.",
	"vo_day1_john_restarttimelock1" : "Ah, the timelock has stopped again. Please start it again, with haste.",
	"vo_day1_john_restarttimelock2" : "I'm losing my patience with this confounded timelock. Fix whatever is preventing the timelock's function.",
	"vo_day1_john_restarttimelock3" : "Is this a fucking joke? Please, fix that fucking timelock.",
	"vo_day1_john_restarttimelock4" : "Looks like some sort of security measure has kicked in to halt the timelock procedure. Would you clear it?",
	"vo_day1_john_safeempty" : "Empty? What a disappointment.",
	"vo_day1_john_smallloot1" : "I didn't figure he would keep such small trinkets stashed away. You may keep those for yourselves.",
	"vo_day1_john_smallloot2" : "Don't worry about these lesser valuables. Keep them for yourselves, if you wish.",
	"vo_day1_john_vaultcamera" : "I see a camera in the vault. That will surely record your theft. And that flies in the face of stealth, does it not?",
	"vo_day1_john_vaultcameradown1" : "The vault camera has been disabled. Grab the treasures inside!",
	"vo_day1_john_vaultcameradown2" : "That camera is down. Our Payday is waiting inside the vault!",
	"vo_day1_john_vaultcameradown3" : "The last obstacle has been done away with. Return to the vault and plunder it.",
	"vo_day1_pager_alarm1" : "Uhm... I'm not really sure.. I'm going to send over some people, just in case. - Oh, that was the alarm button. Whoops!",
	"vo_day1_pager_alarm2" : "Uh. Well. We don't have a guy called like that working in our security. I'm going to sound the alarm.",
	"vo_day1_pager_alarm3" : "Alright. Uuhm.. That doesn't really make any sense, now does it? I'm going to sound the alarm.",
	"vo_day1_pager_alarm4" : "So that's why broke it.. Nice try, asshole, but you need something more to convice me!",
	"vo_day1_pager_done1" : "Uuh.. Yes. I see. Alright. Now, keep doing your job and I'm sure you'll get promoted some day!",
	"vo_day1_pager_done2" : "Oh, I see. I'm so dumb. Of course! I'll see you later when we get home again.",
	"vo_day1_pager_done3" : "Yeah, yeah. I see. Just remember to turn it back on. I will be hearing from you! Over.",
	"vo_day1_pager_done4" : "Yeah, yeah. I see. Just remember to turn it back on. I will be hearing from you! Over.",
	"vo_day1_pager_last1" : "Uhm.. alright. I believe you now, but.. next time? I'm not going to let this one slip by so easily.",
	"vo_day1_pager_last2" : "Alright, yeah. I get your point. I still don't trust it, though. So.. beware.",
	"vo_day1_pager_last3" : "Ok, I see. But.. know that I won't be so merciful next time, ok?",
	"vo_day1_pager_last4" : "How many times do we have to explain.. that you should NOT PUSH THE RED BUTTON. Do it once more and I'm sending guys over to kick you out PERSONALLY. Get your shit together. Understood?",
	"vo_day1_pager_start1" : "Hello? I got a security notification and I'm just checking in to see if everything is a-ok over here.",
	"vo_day1_pager_start2" : "Hello? Security? I got a message about an intruder in the house. Can you.. confirm this?",
	"vo_day1_pager_start3" : "Yeah, yes. Hi! I'm looking for one of the guards?",
	"vo_day1_pager_start4" : "Euh.. hello? Is this thing even.. Oh! Hey there, listen. I'm just checking in to see if everything is ok here.",
	"vo_day2_definta_advice" : "You're here, any advice? Any way you help us will help you.",
	"vo_day2_definta_bait" : "Come on.. Buy the bait.. Buy it..",
	"vo_day2_definta_boatbeingsorted" : "Okay, I'm getting the boat sorted. You guys get driving. Drive, Herbie! Be careful though, these guys aren't gonna want to let the Payday Gang just slip out between the cracks.",
	"vo_day2_definta_boatincoming" : "Okay, boat is on its way now. Nearly there.",
	"vo_day2_definta_bollards" : "Dammit. Bollards. Okay, search for a powerbox or something, get it rewired and get the hell out of here.",
	"vo_day2_definta_cutthelights" : "You heard him. Streetlights. Find some power boxes, and cut them. Make it dark as possible. Hope you brought some flashlights.",
	"vo_day2_definta_getout" : "You've got to be fucking kidding.. Alright, no time to argue, we've gotta get you lot out.",
	"vo_day2_definta_hidefromcops" : "Alright. Get in. Make sure everyone is there! We don't want anyone left behind, leaving a trail for those pigs.",
	"vo_day2_definta_howtoescape" : "We need to get outta here, fast. Oi! You know the place right? Where's the best place out of here?",
	"vo_day2_definta_hurry1" : "You guys deciding to go for a little stroll? Get the hell inside!",
	"vo_day2_definta_hurry2" : "I'm not paying for your legal fees if you get caught; Get in!",
	"vo_day2_definta_hurry3" : "No, no no no, inside, not outside!",
	"vo_day2_definta_johnresponse" : "Are you fucking kidding me John!? I swear I'm going to fucking kill yo- He dropped the line. He dropped the fucking line. Alright guys, hold tight!",
	"vo_day2_definta_newjobforlater" : "Another job? Well, I'm sure the crew here is always up for more cash. Relevant to right now though, boat's here. Get the bags in and get out.",
	"vo_day2_definta_patchin" : "Patching our contact through now.",
	"vo_day2_definta_stealthblown" : "Crap, not again! Okay, run RUN! The van is close by anyway, so move it!",
	"vo_day2_definta_stealthintro" : "Okay, cops are gone. They're patrolling, they know we're out here, so try not to get spotted. Don't worry about killing anyone, they won't notice an extra body around. On the other side, don't go on a rampage, I've heard that cops in this district have been issued pagers.",
	"vo_day2_definta_trap" : "It's a trap guys! What the hell is going on!?",
	"vo_day2_definta_wait" : "Okay, okay, stay chill, stay calm, fingers off the triggers, now we wait.",
	"vo_day2_definta_whatishappening" : "Hey! Generic goon! You know what the hell is going on?",
	"vo_day2_definta_whatthehell" : "What the hell!?",
	"vo_day2_definta_winters" : "Is that.. Winters? Dammit, we did NOT need this right now. Get shooting guys, drop him! No way in hell will that self proclaimed badass let you get away - not with the loot. Good luck!",
	"vo_day2_definta_wintersdown" : "Hah! That's what I thought! Run back to the precinct with your tail between your legs!",
	"vo_day2_hans_badnightvision" : "Ha, ok, well... I heard the cops are going through a tight budget and their night vision technology is crap. I bet you can lose them without a doubt if things get dark.",
	"vo_day2_hans_forklift" : "There should be a van nearby. If you take the forklift, you can jump over the wall and get to it.",
	"vo_day2_hans_getbags" : "Oh my... what's that? Those bags there are just lying around. Feel free to grab them. I don't want the cops getting a hold of those, anyway.",
	"vo_day2_hans_hidingspot" : "Yeah, yeah, good job. And since you like hide and seek so much, there's a good hiding spot nearby!",
	"vo_day2_hans_killedmyown" : "Oh really? Does it look like I know? - They just killed one of my own. I should be the one making that question.",
	"vo_day2_hans_nearharbour" : "You should be close to the harbour. If you can get a boat, you can get away easily!",
	"vo_day2_hans_nowtrust" : "Ah, I see, now you trust me again all of the sudden...",
	"vo_day2_hans_upahead" : "Ok, listen up. I have a man waiting up ahead. Just go and talk to him and he will help you.",
	"vo_day2_hans_useinfuture" : "Well, I must admit, you guys are pretty good. I might have a use for you in the future!",
	"vo_day2_dysphorid_trade" : "Welcome. I've got all the jewelry for you right here. You got our.. product?",
	"vo_day2_john_john1" : "You bastards! Not only did the illustrious Payday Gang fail, but then you proceeded to deceive me!",
	"vo_day2_john_john2" : "The police managed to trace my involvement in this affair because of your failure.",
	"vo_day2_john_john3" : "Though I may not have profited, at least I gain immunity from cooperating with the authorities.",
	"vo_day2_john_john4" : "You are about to be in a world of shit. Gentlemen, enjoy!"
